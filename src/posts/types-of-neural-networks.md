# Types of Neural Networks
# Date: November 2, 2023

# Feed Forward Neural Network

A Feed Forward Neural Network is like a series of connected stations, where each station does a simple calculation on incoming data and passes the result forward, all to make a final decision or prediction!




# Convolutional Neural Network

A Convolutional Neural Network is like a special digital camera that not only captures an image but also learns to recognize patterns and objects within it! 

A Convolutional Neural Network is a type of neural network designed to recognize visual patterns directly from pixel images with minimal preprocessing. 

- Very popular in image recognition or computer vision
- Feed Forward Network
- Remember spatial of pictures

# Recurrent Neural Network

A Recurrent Neural Network is like a memory-equipped machine that looks at sequences, such as sentences or time series, and remembers important bits to make decisions!

A Recurrent Neural Network is a neural network that processes sequences by looping its output back into its input, allowing it to maintain memory of previous inputs.

LSTM
- Long Short Term Memories
- A node that has memory in it


GAN
- Two independent convulational neural networks
- Kind of working and test off each other
- One network make dollar bill and one check

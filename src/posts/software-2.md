Based on: https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35

Neural networks are not just another classifier
- They represent a fundamental shift in how we develop software
- Andrej Karpathy calls this  Software 2.0

Software 1.0
- Explicit instructions to the computer written by a programmer
- Written in Python, C++, etc.

Software 2.0 
- Much more abstract
- human unfriendly language
    - Like weights of a neural network
